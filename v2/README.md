# Open Match v2.x Ecosystem

This is the subdirectory holding the examples and dev framework for building an matchmaker based on Open Match v2.x. The following are included:

* the `examples/` directory contains examples of how to write a matchmaker application that interfaces with Open Match. See the README in that directory for more details.
* the `internal/` directory contains modules used by the applications in the `examples/` directory. 
* the `cloudbuild.yaml` file can be used to build container images of the applications in the examples directory. The instructions for using it are in the comments at the top of the file. Instructions for deploying the application container images can be found in the application directories themselves.
